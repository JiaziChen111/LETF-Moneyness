Input: 
- Km: 'B-spline order in moneyness direction'
- Kt: 'B-spline order in time-to-maturity direction'
- dim_mon: number of grid points for estimation in moneyness direction 
- dim_ttm: number of grid points for estimation in time-to-maturity direction
- ikmon: 'parameter for setting the number of B-spline knots in moneyness direction'
- ikttm: 'parameter for setting the number of B-spline knots in time-to-maturity direction'
- tol: convergence tolerance for the Newton method
- maxiter: maximal number of iterations for the Newton method
- L: number of factor functions in the model
- lower_mon: lowest moneyness value to keep in the dataset
- upper_mon: highest moneyness value to keep in the dataset

Output: 'plot of the root mean squared prediction error for 3 different factor dimensions: L=2,3,4'
